            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Alex Laureano — a Florida-based Computer Science student at the Florida Institute of Technology (graduating Dec 2025), passionate about building tools, games, and algorithmic systems that are both functional and expressive. My strengths lie in solving problems with code, rapidly learning new concepts, and bringing ideas to life through interactive software. Whether it's a simulation, a polished UI, or a procedural generator, I thrive on crafting experiences that are technically sound and creatively driven.</p>
